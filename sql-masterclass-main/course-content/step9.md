Meet Leah - she is our mentor who will take the buy and hold strategy otherwise known as the "HODL strategy" or hold on for dear life!

She is risk averse and just wants to leave her initial investment alone because she believes her original holdings will grow over time with low risk.

## Leah's Transaction History

1. She purchases 50 BTC and 50 ETH on Jan 1st 2017
2. She holds onto all of her portfolio and does not sell anything (HODL)
3. She also does not purchase any additional quantity of either crypto
4. By August 29th 2021 (the last date of our price data) - we can assess her individual performance

> Remember that we are simplifying our problem at the moment so Leah's records will actually be different in the final `trading.transactions` dataset!

## The Data

For this simplified scenario - we first need to create a new temp table called `leah_hodl_strategy` using the code below:

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE leah_hodl_strategy AS
SELECT * FROM trading.transactions
WHERE member_id = 'c20ad4'
AND txn_date = '2017-01-01'
AND quantity = 50;
```

You can inspect the data by running the following query after creating the temp table above:

```sql
SELECT * FROM leah_hodl_strategy;
```

| txn_id | member_id | ticker |  txn_date  | txn_type | quantity | percentage_fee |      txn_time       |
| ------ | --------- | ------ | ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
|     12 | c20ad4    | BTC    | 2017-01-01 | BUY      |       50 |           0.30 | 2017-01-01 00:00:00 |
|     26 | c20ad4    | ETH    | 2017-01-01 | BUY      |       50 |           0.30 | 2017-01-01 00:00:00 |
<br>

## Required Metrics

For this basic scenario - we wish to calculate the following metrics:

1. The initial value of her original 50 BTC and 50 ETH purchases
2. The dollar amount of fees she paid for those 2 transactions
3. The final value of her portfolio on August 29th 2021
4. The profitability by dividing her final value by initial value

## Solutions

### Question 1 & 2

We can calculate the first 2 questions using a single query

> 1. The initial value of her original 50 BTC and 50 ETH purchases
> 2. The dollar amount of fees she paid for those 2 transactions

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(transactions.quantity * prices.price) AS initial_value,
  SUM(transactions.quantity * prices.price * transactions.percentage_fee / 100) AS fees
FROM leah_hodl_strategy AS transactions
INNER JOIN trading.prices
  ON transactions.ticker = prices.ticker
  AND transactions.txn_date = prices.market_date;
```

</details><br>

| initial_value |         fees         |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
|      50180.00 | 150.5400000000000000 |
<br>

### Question 3

> The final value of her portfolio on August 29th 2021

<details><summary>Click here to reveal the solution!</summary><br>

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(transactions.quantity * prices.price) AS final_value
FROM leah_hodl_strategy AS transactions
INNER JOIN trading.prices
  ON transactions.ticker = prices.ticker
WHERE prices.market_date = '2021-08-29';
```

</details><br>

| final_value |
| ----------- |
|  2571642.00 |

### Question 4

> Calculate the profitability by dividing Leah's final value by initial value

We can actually do one better and combine all 4 metrics into a single query!

<details><summary>Click here to reveal the solution!</summary><br>

```sql
WITH cte_portfolio_values AS (
  SELECT
    -- initial metrics
    SUM(transactions.quantity * initial.price) AS initial_value,
    SUM(transactions.quantity * initial.price * transactions.percentage_fee / 100) AS fees,
    -- final value
    SUM(transactions.quantity * final.price) AS final_value
  FROM leah_hodl_strategy AS transactions
  INNER JOIN trading.prices AS initial
    ON transactions.ticker = initial.ticker
    AND transactions.txn_date = initial.market_date
  INNER JOIN trading.prices AS final
    ON transactions.ticker = final.ticker
  WHERE final.market_date = '2021-08-29'
)
SELECT
  initial_value,
  fees,
  final_value,
  final_value / initial_value AS profitability
FROM cte_portfolio_values;
```

</details><br>

| initial_value |         fees         | final_value |    profitability    |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
|      50180.00 | 150.5400000000000000 |  2571642.00 | 51.2483459545635711 |
